    Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    One of the advantages of areaDetector is that it enables the use of generic image
    display clients that obtain their data via EPICS Channel Access and work with any
    detector. There are currently two such generic clients provided with the areaDetector
    distribution. The first is a plugin for the popular ImageJ Java-based image processing
    program. The second is an IDL-based viewer which can be run without an IDL license
    under the IDL Virtual Machine. Because ImageJ is free and more widely available
    and used than IDL, future enhancements are more likely to be done on the ImageJ
    plugin rather than the IDL viewer.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ImageJ">
    ImageJ Viewer</h2>
  <p>
    This is a plugin for the popular <a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>
    program that can be used to display 2-dimensional array data that the <a href="NDPluginStdArrays.html">
      NDStdArrays plugin</a> sends to EPICS. This plugin is contained in the areaDetector
    distribution in the Viewers/ImageJ/EPICS_areaDetector directory. This plugin was
    begun by Tim Madden from APS, and now includes support for all NDArray data types
    and color modes, i.e. Mono, RGB1 (pixel interleave), RGB2 (row interleave) and RGB3
    (plane interleave). The plugin directory includes a plugin written elsewhere for
    reading and writing netCDF files, so ImageJ can be used to display images and image
    sequences (movies) saved with the NDFileNetCDF plugin. It also includes a dynamic
    profile plugin written elsewhere for line profiles that update in real time as new
    images are displayed or as the profile line segment is moved.</p>
  <p>
    To use this ImageJ plugin do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Install ImageJ from <a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html">ImageJ download
      site</a>. If installing on Windows I recommend installing the version bundled with
      Java.</li>
    <li>Copy the the entire directory Viewers/ImageJ/EPICS_areaDetector to the plugins/
      directory in the ImageJ installation location. </li>
    <li>If you installed areaDetector from the prebuilt binary distribution you will already
      have the necessary .class files in that directory, and do not need to compile the
      Java source code. If you installed areaDetector from source code you will need to
      compile the Java code. On Windows this can be done in the ImageJ Plugins/Compile
      and Run menu. Browse for EPICS_AD_Viewer.java to compile and run it. The compilation
      step only needs to be done once, creating the required .class files.</li>
    <li>EPICS_AD_Viewer uses the pure-Java libraries for EPICS Channel Access. This means
      that unlike the IDL Viewer, no C-based shareable-libraries or DLLs are needed. If
      the default EPICS Channel Access settings are appropriate then it is not necessary
      to configure the Java Channel Access library. If configuration is needed then it
      is important to realize that the pure Java Channel Access code does <i>not</i> use
      the environment variables for configuring EPICS that are used by the standard C
      Channel Access code. Java Channel Access configuration is explained in the <a href="http://jca.cosylab.com/apidocs/gov/aps/jca/JCALibrary.html#CHANNEL_ACCESS_JAVA">
        CosyLab CAJ documentation</a>. The simplest way to do this is to create the file
      &lt;jre home&gt;/lib/JCALibrary.properties, containing lines like the following
      <pre>    gov.aps.jca.Context.addr_list=localhost 164.54.160.255 
    gov.aps.jca.Context.auto_addr_list=false 
    gov.aps.jca.Context.max_array_bytes=100000000 
  </pre>
      With the Windows installation of ImageJ &lt;jre home&gt; will typically be C:\Program
      Files\ImageJ\jre\lib. On Linux it will be wherever the jre/lib directory for Java
      is located. Note that it should be necessary to create such a configuration file
      on almost all areaDetector clients because the CAJ default value of max_array_bytes
      is 16384, which will be too small for almost any detector. However, it appears that
      the CAJ library actually ignores the value of max_array_bytes, so it is not actually
      necessary to set its value for the EPICS_AD_Viewer plugin. </li>
    <li>Start ImageJ and go to the Plugins/EPICS_areaDetector/EPICS_AD_Viewer to run the
      plugin</li>
    <li>Type in the prefix for the NDStdArrays plugin for the detector to be viewed (e.g.
      13SIM1:image1:). You should get a message saying that the PVs have connected. If
      you don't the most likely problem is a firewall.</li>
    <li>Press the Start button to begin displaying images.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The control window for <code>EPICS_AD_Viewer</code> is shown below. The PVPrefix
    field is used to input the base name of the EPICS PVs with the image data. The array
    dimensions and the number of frames
    per second actually being displayed by ImageJ is shown. There is a status window that
    shows whether the EPICS PVs are connected and the number of arrays received since the last
    update, which is every 2 seconds.
    <p>To capture a sequence of images into an ImageJ "stack" select "Capture To Stack".
      The image sequence will be stored in the ImageJ buffer and a scroll bar will appear
      to allow you to scroll through the images. The stack can be saved to disk in a large
      number of formats, including AVI.<p>

    IDL Viewer</h2>
  <p>
    There is an IDL procedure called <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/idl/imaging_routines.html#epics_ad_display">
      epics_ad_display</a> that can be used to display 2-dimensional array data that
    the <a href="NDPluginStdArrays.html">NDStdArrays plugin</a> sends to EPICS. This
    IDL client is available as source code (which requires an IDL license), and also
    as a pre-built IDL .sav file that can be run for free under the IDL Virtual Machine.
    This IDL program can run on any machine that IDL runs on, and that has the ezcaIDL
    shareable library built for it. This includes Windows, Linux, Solaris, and Mac.
    <code>epics_ad_display</code> is included in the <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/IDL/imaging.html">
      CARS IDL imaging software.</a> It is also available in the Viewers/IDL directory
    in the areaDetector application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Viewers/IDL directory contains both the IDL source code and a standalone IDL
    file, epics_ad_display.sav, for the epics_ad_display GUI to display images from
    areaDetector detectors. This file can be run for free on any Linux or Windows system
    under the IDL Virtual Machine, which can be downloaded free of charge from <a href="http://www.ittvis.com/idl">
      ITT VIS</a>. That directory also contains the shareable libraries used to call
    EPICS Channel Access from IDL (ezcaIDL.dll for Windows and libezcaIDL.so for Linux).
    Before using the IDL source code or .sav file it is necessary to define the environment
    variable EZCA_IDL_SHARE to point to the complete path to ezcaIDL.dll or libezcaIDL.so.
    For example on Linux:</p>
  <pre>setenv EZCA_IDL_SHARE /home/epics/support/areaDetector/1-5/Viewers/IDL/libezcaIDL.so
  </pre>
  <p>
    On Windows use
  </p>
  <pre>My Computer/Properties/Advanced/Environment Variables/ 
  </pre>
  <p>
    to add a new environment variable EZCA_IDL_SHARE to point to the location of ezcaIDL.dll
    on your system. To run the standalone IDL epics_ad_display.sav file without an IDL
    license exectute the following on Linux:</p>
  <pre>idl -32 -vm=epics_ad_display.sav 
  </pre>
  <p>
    On Windows simply double-click on the icon for the epics_ad_display.sav file.</p>
  <p>
    When the GUI comes up type the base PV name for the NDStdArrays plugin for your
    detector in the "Base PV" widget. For example with the simulation detector supplied
    with the areaDetector application this is "13SIM1:image1:" (without the quotes).
    Once the detector begins acquiring images they should be displayed in the IDL window.
  </p>
  <p>
    To run the GUI from the IDL command line on a system with an IDL license type the
    epics_ad_display command followed by the base PV name of the NDStdArrays plugin.
    For example:
  </p>
  <pre>  IDL> epics_ad_display, '13SIM1:image1:'
  </pre>
  <p>
    The control window for <code>epics_ad_display</code> is shown below. It has a field
    to input the base name of the EPICS PVs with the image data. It also has fields
    to enable/display the IDL display update, to change the display mode, to autoscale
    the intensity, and to invert the image in the Y direction. If autoscale is set to
    No then manual scaling can be entered in the Min and Max fields. The number of frames
    per second actually being displayed by IDL is shown. There is a status window that
    shows whether the EPICS PVs are connected and the time the last was array received,
    updated once per second.
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h3>
      Main window for IDL epics_ad_display</h3>
    <p>
      <img alt="IDL_epics_ad_display.png" src="IDL_epics_ad_display.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    <code>epics_ad_display</code> can use the simple IDL routine <code>tv</code> to
    display the images. This is the fastest mode, and results in a non-scalable unadorned
    window.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h3>

    <p>
      <img alt="IDL_epics_ad_display_tv.jpg" src="IDL_epics_ad_display_tv.jpg" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    <code>epics_ad_display</code> can also use the routine <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/IDL/imaging_routines.html#IMAGE_DISPLAY">
      image_display.pro</a> to display the images. This routine displays row and column
    profiles as the cursor is moved. It allows changing the color lookup tables, and
    zooming in (right mouse click) and out (left mouse click). Note that image_display
    is not currently capable of displaying color data i.e., RGB1, RGB2, or RGB3 NDArrays).
    It can however, display Mono data in false color. The following is an example of
    <code>image_display</code> displaying an image from the simulation detector.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">

  </div>
  <p>
    The Viewers/IDL directory also contains an IDL function to read the areaDetector
    netCDF files. This is described in the <a href="NDPluginFile.html#netCDF">NDPluginFile
      netCDF</a> documentation.</p>
  <p>
    Stephen Mudie at the Australian Synchrotron has written a very nice IDL client to
    display the EPICS images from the Flea Firewire cameras. This client is being converted
    to display the data from this areaDetector plugin, and will be provided in a future
    release of areaDetector.
