    Overview</h2>
  <p>
    A powerful feature of the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/">EPICS</a> <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html">
      areaDetector</a> module is the concept of plugins. A plugin is code that is called
    by a driver that passes NDArray data in a callback. Plugins can be used to process
    array data in real time. Existing plugins do operations such as compute statistics
    (NDPluginStats), convert data to standard asyn arrays (NDPluginStdArrays), save
    data to disk (NDPluginFile), select regions-of-interest (NDPluginROI), as well as
    many more. New plugins can be written to perform specialized functions. Once a plugin
    is written it will work with any areaDetector driver. Plugins have the the following
    properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>They can execute either in a blocking mode or a non-blocking mode. In the blocking
      mode the callback is executed by the driver callback thread. In this mode the callback
      is guaranteed to execute for each NDArray callback. However, it can slow down the
      driver, and does not utilize the multi-core capability of modern CPUs. In the non-blocking
      mode the driver callback simply places the NDArray data in a queue that is part
      of the plugin. The plugin then executes the callback code in one or more of its
      own threads. It removes NDArray data from the queue, processes it, and releases
      the data back to the NDArrayPool when it is done. In the non-blocking mode some
      additional memory is required for the NDArray objects that are in the queue. It
      is also possible to drop NDArray data if the queue is full when a callback occurs,
      i.e. some callback data will not be processed. The non-blocking mode can utilize
      the multi-core capabilities of modern CPUs because each plugin is executing in its
      own threads. The operation of the queue and the NDArrayPool class means that data
      never needs to be copied unless it is modified, each plugin has a pointer to the
      data which will continue to be valid until the last plugin is done with it.</li>
    <li>They can be enabled or disabled at run time.</li>
    <li>They can be throttled to only execute at a limited rate. This means, for example,
      that a detector can be saving data to disk at full speed, but images can be posted
      to EPICS at a reduced rate.</li>
    <li>They can be unplugged from one driver, and plugged into another driver at run
      time. For example, the NDPluginROI driver is itself a source of NDArray data callbacks,
      so a file saving plugin could be unplugged from a detector driver (where it would
      be saving the entire detector), and plugged into a particular ROI, where it would
      just save a portion of the detector. Similarly the NDPluginColorConvert plugin is
      also a source of NDArray data callbacks. A pipeline of plugins can be constructed,
      for example NDPluginColorConvert-&gt;NDPluginROI-&gt;NDPluginStdArrays. Each stage
      of this pipeline can be executing in its own threads, and on modern multi-core processors
      each can be executing on its own cores.</li>
    <li>In non-blocking mode the maximum allowed number of threads is fixed when the plugin
      is created, but the actual number of threads to use can be changed from 1 to this
      upper limit at run time.</li>
    <li>When there are multiple threads in use it is likely that the output NDArrays will
      not be in the correct order of ascending values of NDArray::UniqueId because each
      thread is processing asynchronously. All plugins therefore have an option to sort
      the output arrays before sending them. This comes at the expense of an increase
      in memory use and latency between the input and output arrays.</li>
    <li>Plugins store the last input array so they can be processed again with different
      settings without waiting for a new input array to arrive.</li>
  </ul>

    NDPluginDriver</h2>
  <p>
    NDPluginDriver inherits from <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#asynNDArrayDriver">asynNDArrayDriver</a>.
    NDPluginDriver is the class from which actual plugins are directly derived. The
    EPICS database NDArrayBase.template provides access to each of the parameters defined
    in asynNDArrayDriver, and the <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#asynNDArrayDriver">asynNDArrayDriver</a>
    documentation describes that database. The NDPluginDriver class handles most of
    the details of processing NDArray callbacks from the driver. Plugins derived from
    this class typically need to implement the processCallbacks method, and one or more
    of the write(Int32, Float64, Octet) methods. The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_plugin_driver.html">
      NDPluginDriver class documentation </a>describes this class in detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    NDPluginDriver defines parameters that all plugin drivers should implement if possible.
    These parameters are defined by strings (drvInfo strings in asyn) with an associated
    asyn interface, and access (read-only or read-write). The EPICS database NDPluginBase.template
    provides access to these standard plugin parameters, listed in the following table.
    Note that to reduce the width of this table the parameter index variable names have
    been split into 2 lines, but these are just a single name, for example <code>NDPluginDriverArrayPort</code>.

          <b>Sorting of output NDArrays</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="7,">
          When using a plugin with multiple threads, or when the input plugin is NDPluginGather
          it is likely that the NDArray output will be slightly out of order, i.e. NDArray::uniqueId
          fields will not be monotonically increasing. This is because the threads are running
          asynchronously and at slightly different speeds.&nbsp; As a consequence a file plugin
          downstream of this plugin would write NDArrays to the file in the "wrong" order.
          Plugins have an option to sort the NDArrays by uniqueId to attempt to output them
          in the correct order. This sorting option is enabled by setting SortMode=Sorted,
          and works using the following algorithm:
          <ul>
            <li>An std::multiset object is created to store the NDArray output pointers as they
              are received in NDArrayDriver::doNDArrayCallbacks. This is the method that all derived
              classes must call to output NDArrays to downstream plugins. This std::multiset also
              stores the time at which each NDArray was received by the NDArrayDriver::doNDArrayCallbacks
              method. This multiset is automatically sorted by the uniqueId of each NDArray.</li>
            <li>A worker thread is created which processes at the time interval specified by SortTime.
              This thread outputs the next array (NDArray[N]) in the multiset if any of the following
              are true:
              <ul>
                <li>NDArray[N].uniqueId = NDArray[N-1].uniqueId. This allows for the case where multiple
                  upstream plugins are processing the same NDArray. This may happen, for example,
                  if NDPluginGather is being used and not all of its inputs are getting their NDArrays
                  from from NDPluginScatter.</li>
                <li>NDArray[N].uniqueId = NDArray[N-1].uniqueId + 1. This is the normal case.</li>
                <li>NDArray[N] has been in the multiset for longer than SortTime. This will be the
                  case if the next array that <i>should</i> have been output has not arrived, perhaps
                  because it has been dropped by some upstream plugin and will never arrive. Increasing
                  the SortTime will allow longer for out of order arrays to arrive, at the expense
                  of more memory because the multiset will grow larger before outputting the arrays.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          When NDArrays are added to the multiset they have their reference count increased,
          and so will still be consuming memory. The multiset is limited in size to SortSize.
          If the multiset would grow larger than this because arrays are arriving faster than
          they are being removed with the specified SortTime, then they will be dropped in
          the same manner as when NDArrays are dropped from the normal input queue. In this
          case DroppedOutputArrays will be incremented. Note that because NDArrays can be
          stored in both the normal input queue and the multiset the total memory potentially
          used by the plugin is determined by both QueueSize and SortSize.<br />
          If the plugin is receiving 500 NDArrays/s (2 ms period), and the maximum time the
          plugin threads require to execute is 20 msec, then the minimum value of SortTime
          should be 0.02 sec, and the minimum value of SortSize would be 10. It is a good
          idea to add a safety margin to these values, so perhaps SortSize=50 and SortTime=0.04
          sec.</td>

    Guidelines and rules for plugins</h2>
  <p>
    The following are guidelines and rules for writing plugins</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Plugins will almost always implement the processCallbacks() function. This function
      will be called with an NDArray pointer each time an NDArray callback occurs. This
      function will normally call the NDPluginDriver::processCallbacks() base class function,
      which handles tasks common to all plugins, including callbacks with information
      about the array, etc.</li>
    <li>Plugins will generally implement one or more of the writeInt32(), writeFloat64()
      or writeOctet() functions if they need to act immediately on a new value of a parameter.
      For many parameters it is normally sufficient to simply have them written to the
      parameter library, and not to handle them in the writeXXX() functions. The parameters
      are then retrieved from the parameter library with the getIntParam(), getDoubleParam(),
      or getStringParam() function calls when they are needed.</li>
    <li>If the writeInt32(), writeFloat64() or writeOctet() functions are implemented
      they <b>must</b> call the base class function for parameters that they do not handle
      and whose parameter index value is less than the first parameter of this class,
      i.e. parameters that belong to a base class.</li>
    <li>Plugins will need to call the createParam() function in their constructor if they
      have additional parameters beyond those in the asynPortDriver or NDPluginDriver
      base classes.</li>
    <li>Plugins may <b>never</b> modify the NDArray that they receive in the processCallbacks()
      function. The reason is that other plugins may be concurrently operating on the
      same NDArray, since each is passed the same pointer. This means also that when getting
      the attributes for this plugin that asynNDArrayDriver::getAttributes(pArray->pAttributeList)
      must not be called with the NDArray passed to processCallbacks(), because that will
      modify the NDArray attribute list, and hence the NDArray that other plugins are
      operating on. Plugins such as NDPluginROI and NDPluginColorConvert create new NDArrays
      via NDArrayPool::copy() or NDArrayPool::convert() (which copy the attributes to
      the new array) and then call getAttributes(pArray->pAttributeList) with the new
      array.</li>
    <li>Plugins must release their mutex by calling this->unlock() when they do time-consuming
      operations. If they do not then they will not be able to queue new NDArrays callbacks
      or obtain new parameter values. Obviously they must not access memory locations
      that other threads could modify during this time, so they should only access local
      variables, not class variables (which includes the parameter library).</li>
    <li>If plugins generate new or modified NDArrays then they must call NDPluginDriver::doNDArrayCallbacks()
      so that registered clients can get the values of the new arrays.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="medm">
    Base class medm screens</h2>
  <p>
    There are 2 medm screens for the NDPluginDriver. The first is NDPluginBase.adl.
    This exposes a subset of the EPICS PVs for the NDPluginDriver base class. It is
    normally included in the medm screen for every plugin. For example, the following
    is the medm screen for the NDPluginStdArrays plugin. Because this plugin does not
    have any additional records beyond those in the NDPluginDriver base class, this
    medm screen consists only the NDPluginBase.adl file.
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginBase.png" src="NDPluginBase.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    NDPluginBase.adl displays only the PVs that are most commonly used, and does not
    expose the PVs that are intended more for expert configuration. NDPluginBaseFull.adl
    displays all of the PVs in NDPluginDriver base class, include those controlling
    the queue size, number of threads, output array sorting, etc. This display can be
    opened from the More related display menu in NDPluginBase.adl.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="commonPlugins">
    commonPlugins.cmd</h2>
  <p>
    The ADCore/iocBoot directory contains a file called EXAMPLE_commonPlugins.cmd. This
    file should be copied to commonPlugins.cmd and edited for site-specific requirements.
    commonPlugins.cmd is loaded by all of the example driver IOC startup scripts. It
    loads a set of plugins which are typically useful for detectors IOCs. Each detector
    medm screen has links to related displays for each of the common plugins. While
    this set of plugins is often useful and sufficient, users are free to add or remove
    plugins from this set for their own IOCs. New medm displays will typically need
    to be created if that is done, to have the required links to related displays.</p>
  <p>
    The following medm screen shows the status of all of the common plugins at a glance,
    with links to bring up the detailed screen for each.</p>

    Performance example</h2>
  <p>
    The following example shows how increasing the number of threads from 1 to 5 in
    the NDPluginStats statistics plugins allows it to keep up with the simDetector running
    at about 485 frames/s. It also demonstrates the effect of changing SortMode=Sorted
    and SortMode=Unsorted.</p>
  <p>
    The images were generated by simDetector generating 1024x1024 Float32 images at
    about 485 frames/s as shown in the following 2 medm screens.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_simDetector.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_simDetector.png" /></p>
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_simDetectorSetup.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_simDetectorSetup.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The NDPluginStats plugin was configured to perform all of the statistics calculations
    (centroid, histogram, etc.) to maximize the time required to process each array,
    as shown in the following medm screen.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_NDStats.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_NDStats.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The statistics plugin was first run with just one thread, as shown in the NDPluginBaseFull.adl
    screen. This screen can be opened with the More related display from the NDPluginBase.adl
    screen, which is embedded on the left hand side of all plugin medm screens. Note
    the following on this screen:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The execution time is 8 ms.</li>
    <li>The frame rate is 120 frames/s, which is consistent with the execution time.</li>
    <li>The queue free size is 0, and the number of dropped frames is large because the
      plugin cannot keep up with the rate at which the simDetector is sending frames (485
      frames/s).</li>
    <li>SortedMode=Sorted is selected. Because there is only 1 thread SortMode does not
      really matter, the order of the output NDArrays will be the same whether SortMode
      is Sorted or Unsorted.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_StatsFull_1thread.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_StatsFull_1thread.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The following show the Linux "top" program when the plugin is running with 1 thread
    as above. Note that the STATS5_Plugin_1 thread is using almost 100% of a core. The
    simDetector is using about 58% of a core.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_top_1thread.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_top_1thread.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The NumThreads PV in the statistics plugin was then changed from 1 to 3, as shown
    in the following NDPluginBaseFull.adl screen. Note the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The execution time is still 8 ms.</li>
    <li>The frame rate is now 384 frames/s, which is just over 3 times the value with
      1 thread above.</li>
    <li>The queue free size is 0, and the number of dropped frames is large because the
      plugin still cannot keep up with the rate at which the simDetector is sending frames
      (485 frames/s).</li>
    <li>SortedMode=Sorted is selected. Because there are now 3 threads SortMode does matter,
      because the 3 threads could be producing output NDArrays in the wrong order. However,
      the number of disordered frames is still large, because dropped input frames will
      lead to missing values of NDArray::uniqueId on the output arrays, which is counted
      in the Disordered arrays.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_StatsFull_3thread.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_StatsFull_3thread.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The following show the Linux "top" program when the plugin is running with 3 threads
    as above. Note that there are now 3 STATS5_Plugin_N threads, each using almost 100%
    of a core.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_top_3thread.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_top_3thread.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The NumThreads PV in the statistics plugin was then changed from 3 to 5, as shown
    in the following NDPluginBaseFull.adl screen. Note the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The execution time is still about 8 ms.</li>
    <li>The frame rate is now 482 frames/s, which is just over 4 times the value with
      1 thread above.</li>
    <li>The queue free size is 200, and the number of dropped frames is 0 because the
      plugin can now keep up with the rate at which the simDetector is sending frames
      (482 frames/s).</li>
    <li>SortedMode=Sorted is selected. Because there are now 5 threads SortMode does matter,
      because the 5 threads could be producing output NDArrays in the wrong order. Now
      the number of disordered frames is 0, because there are no dropped input frames
      and the SortSize (50) and SortTime (0.05 sec) are sufficient to allow the output
      frames to be sorted without dropping any output frames (DroppedOutputArrays=0).</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_StatsFull_5thread.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_StatsFull_5thread.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The following show the Linux "top" program when the plugin is running with 5 threads
    as above. Note that there are now 5 STATS5_Plugin_N threads, each using about 87%
    of a core.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <p>
      <img alt="NDPluginDriverExample_top_5thread.png" src="NDPluginDriverExample_top_5thread.png" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    To test sorting of output NDArrays the simDetector was configured to generate 100
    arrays in Multiple mode, and the NDFileNetCDF plugin was configured to save 100
    arrays in Stream mode. The netCDF plugin received its NDArrays from the STATS5 plugin
    running with 5 threads as shown above. The test was done 2 times, once with SortMode=Sorted,
    and then with SortMode=Unsorted. The files are were then read into IDL, using the
    read_nd_netcdf.pro file that can be found in ADCore/Viewers/IDL.</p>
  <p>
    The following shows the output when reading the file that was written when SortMode=Sorted.
    attr[0].pvalue is the value of the UniqueId attribute for all 100 NDArrays. Note
    that the arrays are all in the correct UniqueId order.
